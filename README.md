# Mystery-Word Game (Hangman) :abc: c _ d _ n g


I built a Node.js Express application that uses Sessions to persist data from one page to the next. This was the first major backend project I created and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out, hope you enjoy!

This project is deployed on Heroku [here](https://thawing-thicket-28274.herokuapp.com/login).

### Built with
* Node.js (version 8)
* Express 
* Mustache template

### To run locally:
* Clone this repo
* In your terminal type `git clone` and the url you copied
* Make sure you have Node installed on your machine
  * Check to see if you have node installed by typing the following in your terminal:
  ```
  node -v
  ```
  * If you don't have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, then first run:
  ```
  /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
  ```
  * Now install Node using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with the following command:
  ```
  brew install node@8
  ```
* Once you have Node installed type `npm install` which will download all of the dependencies required for this application
* Now type `node app.js`, then point a browser window to `localhost:3000`, and enjoy! (and prepare to learn some new words) :grinning: :laughing:
